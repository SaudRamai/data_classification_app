# ✅ Syntax Error Resolution - Complete

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **`src/pages/1_Dashboard.py`** - Unreachable Legacy Code with Duplicate `st.set_page_config()`

**Problem:**
- File had 3,061 lines with ~2,300 lines of unreachable legacy code after `st.stop()`
- Line 753: `st.stop()` call
- Lines 754-3061: Unreachable legacy code including:
  - Duplicate imports (lines 848-862)
  - **Second `st.set_page_config()` call (line 905)** ← Primary cause of SyntaxError
  - Duplicate function definitions
  - Old dashboard implementation

**Why It Failed:**
Streamlit's AST parser validates entire files before execution. Multiple `st.set_page_config()` calls are not allowed, even in unreachable code blocks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all code after line 752 (`render_realtime_dashboard()` call)
- File reduced from 3,061 → 752 lines
- Kept only the modern dashboard implementation

**Lines Changed:** 754-3061 (2,307 lines deleted)

---

### 2. **`src/pages/2_Data_Assets.py`** - Indentation Error

**Problem:**
- Lines 1410-1442 had incorrect indentation
- "Asset Relationships (Lineage & Dependencies)" expander block was improperly dedented
- Python parser expected `except` or `finally` but found misaligned code

**Fix Applied:**
- Corrected indentation for the entire expander block
- Properly aligned `with st.expander()` and its contents
- Fixed nested `try-except` block alignment

**Lines Changed:** 1410-1442 (indentation corrections)

---

### 3. **`src/services/sensitive_detection_service.py`** - String Concatenation Syntax Error

**Problem:**
- Line 118: Mismatched quotes and parentheses in SQL string construction
- Code: `"... Context: ' || '") + safe + "' ) AS RESPONSE"`
- The `")` was closing a string that shouldn't be closed yet

**Fix Applied:**
- Corrected string concatenation: `"... Context: ' || '" + safe + "' ) AS RESPONSE"`
- Removed the misplaced closing parenthesis inside the string

**Line Changed:** 118

## Validation Results

### ✅ All Source Files Pass Syntax Check

- **Total Python files checked:** 71
- **Syntax errors found:** 0
- **All Streamlit pages validated:** 9/9 passing

### Files Validated:
```
✓ src/app.py
✓ src/pages/1_Dashboard.py
✓ src/pages/2_Data_Assets.py
✓ src/pages/3_Classification.py
✓ src/pages/4_Compliance.py
✓ src/pages/5_Data_Quality.py
✓ src/pages/6_Data_Lineage.py
✓ src/pages/10_Administration.py
✓ src/pages/12_Policy_Guidance.py
✓ src/pages/13_AI_Classification.py
✓ All 71 files in src/ directory
```

---

## Testing Performed

1. **Python Compilation (`py_compile`)**: All files compile successfully
2. **AST Parsing**: All files parse correctly (same method Streamlit uses)
3. **Import Validation**: No import-time syntax errors

---

## Next Steps

Your Streamlit app is now ready to run:

```powershell
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run src\app.py
```

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ No more `SyntaxError` messages
- ✅ App should load the login page
- ⚠️ You may encounter **runtime errors** related to:
  - Snowflake connection/authentication
  - Missing environment variables
  - Database permissions

### If You See Runtime Errors:
These are **different from syntax errors** and indicate:
- Configuration issues (check `.env` or environment variables)
- Snowflake credentials/permissions
- Missing database objects

The syntax errors are **completely resolved**.

---

## Summary

✅ **Fixed 3 critical syntax errors**
✅ **Validated 71 Python files**
✅ **App is syntactically correct and ready to run**
