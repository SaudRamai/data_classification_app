# Data Classification Policy Implementation Status

Document Classification: Internal

Version: 1.0

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

Document Owner: Chief Data Officer

Approval Authority: Chief Executive Officer

Next Review Date: [Insert Date + 1 Year]

## Executive Summary

- **Implemented highlights**
  - Snowflake-native tagging for classification and CIA levels via `DATA_CLASSIFICATION`, `CONFIDENTIALITY_LEVEL`, `INTEGRITY_LEVEL`, `AVAILABILITY_LEVEL` with enforcement of allowed values.
  - Manual classification workflows, bulk CSV tagging, AI-assisted suggestions, and reclassification workflow with approvals.
  - Compliance monitoring views: masking/row access policy coverage, tag usage, access governance (users/roles/grants), exception management, violation detection, audit logs, and exportable reports.
  - CIA visualization and classification distribution aligned to policy labels and colors.
  - SLA check: unclassified assets flagged against a 5-business-day window (inventory-based).
- **Partial/Not Implemented highlights**
  - Real RBAC and identity integration; current login is a mock session user in `src/app.py`.
  - Formal automated review cadence (monthly/quarterly/annual) and scheduling.
  - Training tracking and attestation for roles.
  - Full policy documentation and approval workflows inside the app.
  - Comprehensive API endpoints (docs exist in `docs/API.md`, but REST server implementation is not present in the codebase).
  - Complete end-to-end lineage-driven risk and BU coverage depends on inventory/unified metadata being populated.

## Policy-by-Section Status

### 1. Introduction
- **Status:** Implemented (context)
- **Evidence:** App describes governance capabilities with Snowflake integration (see `src/app.py`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).

### 2. Purpose and Scope
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:** Snowflake-focused scope in queries (`ACCOUNT_USAGE`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`).
- **Gaps:** Explicit policy text and exclusions/scope are not embedded in the UI.

### 3. Key Definitions
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:** Classification labels and CIA model in code (`tagging_service.py`, CIA UI in `3_Classification.py`).
- **Gaps:** End-user glossary/definitions page not present.

### 4. Data Classification Principles
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:**
  - Risk-based CIA visuals and metrics (CIA matrix in `1_Dashboard.py`).
  - Lifecycle awareness via reclassification workflow (`3_Classification.py`).
  - Auditability via audit logs and exports (`4_Compliance.py`).
  - Consistency through allowed tag values (`tagging_service.validate_tags()`).
- **Gaps:**
  - Business-driven decisions not strongly role-enforced (mock auth).
  - Formal guardrails to prevent over/under-classification are advisory (QA), not enforced.

### 5. Classification Framework
- **5.1 CIA Methodology:** Implemented (0–3 scales).
- **5.2 Attribute Levels:** Partially Implemented (scales exist; descriptive semantics not shown in UI).
- **5.3 Overall Risk:** Implemented (risk based on max(C,I,A) in `3_Classification.py`).
- **5.4 Labels:** Implemented (`ALLOWED_CLASSIFICATIONS` and color mapping in UI).
- **5.4.2 Snowflake Tagging:** Implemented (schema and tags creation, apply/retrieve tags in `tagging_service.py`).
- **5.5 Special Categories:** Partially Implemented (PII/Financial/SOX detection heuristics and QA; no hard enforcement at tagging time).

### 6. Classification Procedures
- **6.1 Initial Classification:** Partially Implemented
  - SLA visualization for 5 business days (`1_Dashboard.py` deadline table), manual/AI/bulk workflows.
  - Requires inventory and discovery processes to be provisioned.
- **6.2 Decision Process:** Partially Implemented
  - CIA entry, validation vs prior tags, AI suggestion with frameworks.
  - Lacks a formalized decision matrix UI and structured rationale capture.
- **6.3 Reclassification:** Implemented (workflow) / Partially Implemented (automated triggers depend on infra).
- **6.4 Quality Assurance:** Partially Implemented (QA review for under-classification; peer/manager/technical review not enforced by roles).

### 7. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:** UI gates for certain actions by pseudo-roles, audit capture of requester/approver.
- **Gaps:** Real SSO/RBAC, ownership mappings, and training requirements are not implemented.

### 8. Policy Compliance
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:** Compliance dashboards, exceptions lifecycle, report stubs, trends, audit.
- **Gaps:** Scheduled compliance reviews, training tracking, and strong approval matrices.

### 9. Appendices
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Implemented:** CIA matrix, classification distribution, QA decision aids.
- **Gaps:** In-app quick reference/decision tree/checklist pages.

## Snowflake Tagging and Technical Implementation

- **Implemented:**
  - Standard tags with allowed values in `src/services/tagging_service.py`.
  - Idempotent creation of `DATA_GOVERNANCE` schema and tags via `initialize_tagging()`.
  - Object/column tagging using `ALTER ... SET TAG`.
  - Retrieval via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TAG_REFERENCES` and `TAG_REFERENCES_ALL_COLUMNS`.
  - Coverage derived from `DATA_CLASSIFICATION` tag references (`1_Dashboard.py`).
- **Dependencies:**
  - `settings.SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` configured and Snowflake privileges.
  - Inventory tables referenced (e.g., `DATA_GOVERNANCE.ASSET_INVENTORY`, `RECLASSIFICATION_REQUESTS`, `REVIEW_SCHEDULES`) must exist.

---

## Gaps and Recommended Actions

- **Authentication and RBAC**
  - Gap: Mock login; no SSO/IdP or RBAC enforcement.
  - Action: Integrate SSO (Okta/Azure AD); enforce role-based permissions for Data Owner, Custodian, Admin, Compliance Officer.

- **Inventory and Scheduling**
  - Gap: Inventory population and scheduled scans not evidenced.
  - Action: Implement discovery jobs to populate `ASSET_INVENTORY`; Snowflake Tasks/Streams for daily/weekly scans.

- **SLA Enforcement (5 business days)**
  - Gap: Analytics only.
  - Action: Add notifications (email/Slack), overdue alerts, and optional access gating for unclassified high-risk assets.

- **Special Categories Enforcement (Policy 5.5)**
  - Gap: Advisory-only checks.
  - Action: Enforce minimum C at tagging with exception workflow for overrides.

- **Formal Reviews and Approvals**
  - Gap: No peer/manager/technical gates.
  - Action: Add review stages, approver roles, templates, and sign-offs stored in Snowflake.

- **Exception Management Governance**
  - Gap: No approval matrix; limited reminders.
  - Action: Configure org-based approval routing, reminders, and automatic expiry actions.

- **Training and Attestation**
  - Gap: Not tracked.
  - Action: Add training record table; gate sensitive actions by training status.

- **API Layer**
  - Gap: REST API not implemented (spec only in `docs/API.md`).
  - Action: Add FastAPI (or Streamlit endpoints) secured with SSO/tokens.

- **Policy Documentation in App**
  - Gap: No embedded policy/decision tree/checklist.
  - Action: Add a "Policy" page with decision tree, quick reference, examples, and acknowledgment.

- **Audit and Evidence**
  - Gap: Centralized, immutable retention not demonstrated.
  - Action: Stream logs to Snowflake/S3 with retention and export.

## 60–90 Day Roadmap (Prioritized)

- **Phase 1 (0–30 days)**
  - Implement SSO/RBAC and enforce role gates in classification/reclassification/exception actions.
  - Provision/validate `DATA_GOVERNANCE` tables: `ASSET_INVENTORY`, `RECLASSIFICATION_REQUESTS`, `REVIEW_SCHEDULES`, `COMPLIANCE_REPORTS`.
  - Enforce 5-day SLA via alerts; add email notifications.

- **Phase 2 (30–60 days)**
  - Enforce Special Categories minimums at tagging with exception workflow.
  - Add review stages with peer/management/technical approvals and templates.
  - Add a Policy & Help page with decision tree and checklist; pre-fill AI rationale.

- **Phase 3 (60–90 days)**
  - Scheduled compliance jobs via Snowflake Tasks.
  - Training attestation and gating of actions.
  - Minimal REST API (FastAPI) aligned to `docs/API.md`.
